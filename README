GREMLINS - Artur M. Curinga Lucas de Medeiros Ferreira
Professor: Selan Rodrigues

This project is a Memory Manegment Based on Linked List and have 3 types:

SLLPool : Simple Linked List Memory Pool using First Fir Strategy
BestSLLPool : Simple Linked List Memory Pool using Best Fit Stretegy
DLPool: Double Linked List Memory Pool using First Fit Strategy

############################GREMLINS###########################################################

Test Types:

Visual Graphical Debug using SFML:

Avaliable for SLLPool and BestSLLPool, where you can see in a SFML windown Green Bars for free areas and Red Bars as "Taken" ocupied memory. Every Area is numbered in List order.

Text Debug:

Avaliable for SLLPool and BestSLLPool, where there is  "-" sign representing the Free Blocks and "+" sign representing Used Block. 


TimeTest:

Avaliable for alll Pools, used to test random Alloc and Free, and simulates a real application and compare the time.

###########################Test Samples########################################################

One Block Test:
File: dreive_oneblock.cpp

Create a situation where all blocks (one) is used with the exact size.




Two Block Test:
File: drive_2block.cpp

Create a situation where all possibles allocs and free are used



Three Block Test:
File: drive_3block.cpp

Create all situation for 3 blocks with Visual Debug. Can be tested with makefile, just using make, and runing with make roll



TimeTest:
File:TimeTest.cpp

USE O3 FOR COMPILING OPTMZATION!!!!!!

This test is used to mesure time and see the pattern in memory pools, There are 2 test for SLLPool and BestSLLPool and One with stardard std::malloc and std::free.

The first situation is a memory Pool used in 30 tests with random alloc and free with the same mem.Pool where you can see the fragmentation incresing time.

The second is the same test but with a new memPool every test

The same test is executed by OS.




TimeTest Single Shot (Vinicius Campos e VitorRodrigues implemetation)
File:drive_simulation.cpp

USE O3 FOR COMPILING OPTMZATION!!!!!!

Single test using a large memPool and checking Alloc and Free time of OS or mem Pool, to change the test target i'ts needed to uncomment the new and comment the other new operator 


######################################Personal Notes##########################################

The time test may have different results deppending of OS, type of PC, compiling mode.
